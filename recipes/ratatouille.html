    <h2>Ratatouille</h2>
        <p>My mom has been making some version of this recipe since before I can remember. To this day it reminds me of those first weeks of 
            autumn where the leaves finally start to turn and the air feels crisp. </p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Toss 1 large globe eggplant, peeled, coarsely chopped, 1 large zucchini, sliced into ¼-inch-thick 
                rounds, and 2 tsp. kosher salt in a colander. Let sit 30 minutes, then pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat ¼ cup olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof pot over medium-high. Add half of eggplant and 
                zucchini and cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables begin to take on color, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium 
                bowl. Repeat with ¼ cup olive oil and remaining eggplant and zucchini.</li>
            <li>Tie 5 sprigs thyme together with kitchen twine. Heat remaining ¼ cup olive oil in same pot and cook 1 large onion, 
                halved, sliced ½ inch thick, 1 red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped, 2 garlic cloves, thinly 
                sliced, and thyme bundle, stirring occasionally, until onion is beginning to brown and is softened, 8-10 minutes. 
                Add 1 pint cherry tomatoes, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in reserved 
                zucchini and eggplant, then top with remaining 1 pint tomatoes (do not stir); season with salt and freshly ground 
                black pepper. Transfer pot to oven and roast until all vegetables are softened and tomatoes have begun to burst, 
                15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>Remove thyme bundle. Transfer to a serving platter and top with 1 cup torn basil leaves.</em></li>
        </ol>
