    <h2>Vegan Bolognese</h2>
        <p>This is a simple vegan version of a classic bolognese recipe. I'm a life-long fan of Italian food, but I've been choosing to eat 
            less meat as of late, so this is a fantastic alternative. </p>

            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Tamari</li>
            <li>Red Wine</li>
            <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Vegetable broth</li>
            <li>Nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning, bay leaf, salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Large Pan (with high sides) over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the oil and wait until it's shimmering. Add 
                mushrooms and sauté until they have released their moisture, reduced in size and are slightly browned. The pan should be 
                mostly dry.</li>
            <li>Now, reduce heat to medium and add onions, carrots, and garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until cooked down.</li>
            <li>Make a small open space in the pan to add the tomato paste and make sure it's touching the surface. Cook for 30 seconds 
                before combining. Add tamari and Italian seasoning and cook until the herbs are fragrant about 30-60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat to medium-high and pour in the red wine. Cook for 2-3 minutes until it's almost completely reduced.
                Turn the heat back to medium.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, broth, walnuts, nutritional yeast, and bay leaf. Combine and bring to a simmer then reduce to a 
                low simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook until sauce thickens and flavor deepens for about 10-15 minutes (longer for deeper flavor). Add salt and pepper 
                to taste. Remove from heat and let the sauce sit a few minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li><em>Combine with your favorite pasta and serve.</em></li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
